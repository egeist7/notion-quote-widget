            '“What makes your mind stronger, and more able to control your emotions, is internal discipline and toughness. No one can teach you this skill; you cannot learn it by reading about it. Like any discipline, it can come only through practice, experience, even a little suffering.” —Robert Greene',
            '“Arguably the most important skill is controlling your attention. This goes beyond merely avoiding distractions.

            '“Being genuinely excited about what you do, brings a different kind of energy. People can feel it in the room - they prefer it. There is nothing worse than someone who clearly isn\'t invested, and doesn\'t want to be there. Your energy makes an impression.” — Dr. Julie Gurner',
            '“The number one mistake people make is thinking too big on their first business. They try to start the next SpaceX when they should be starting a paving company. Something boring that gets you the money to start the next SpaceX later. Build the launch pad before the rocket.” — Andrew Wilkinson',

So be bold and don’t worry about what people think.” — Tim Ferriss',
            '“If you view everything through the lens of fear, then you tend to stay in retreat mode. You can just as easily see a crisis or problem as a challenge, an opportunity to prove your mettle, the chance to strengthen and toughen yourself, or a call to collective action.” — Robert Greene',
